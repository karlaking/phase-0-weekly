### What does puts do?
`put` simply prints out the output of the program ran. It WILL NOT return the output for future access. 

### What is an integer? What is a float?
Integers are whole numbers. Decimals are not found in integers. They can be negative numbers, or 0. Integers will be rounded down when used in calculations. A float, or floating place decimal number, allows a number to have as many decimal points as necessary

### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
The difference between performing calculations with floats or integers lies in how to deal with the remainder of whole numbers when they do not have on-the-nose whole outputs. Whole number calculations will always round the output down to the nearest integer.
