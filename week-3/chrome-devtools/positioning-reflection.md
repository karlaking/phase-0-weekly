##CSS Positioning 

###Reflection
How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
Chrome DevTools assist in CSS positioning because they allow for instant feedback on how your stylesheet informs your html page. 
How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
Using the width and height CSS elements.
What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
I used the absolute positioning a lot during this challenge. I did not use the others, so I but did attempt to, though they had no effect in the way I used them. For this reason, I'd say absolute is easiest and most helpful, where the others are still a bit of a question mark for me. 
What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
Margin refers to the space outside of the element, padding is  negative space within the element on all sides, where border is the area between.  
What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I thought this challenge was very worth-while. CSS can be your best friend if you have a grasp of how it works, and your worst enemey if you do not embrace all its quirks.
