	<p>You know what I hate? Having a million versions of the same file cluttering my desktop. They read “outputFinal”, “outputFinal_Final”, “outputFinal_REALLY_Final”, and so on. Many GIS files do not allow you to overwrite existing files for fear that you will ruin something. As kind as it is of ESRI to protect my GIS files, the proliferation of these outputs is driving me mad. If only there were another way…. Version Control! Version control in GitHub addresses the concern for preserving file integrity by having a working master repository, while workers modify copies separately. Rather than creating multiple files, each worker merges their changes with the master repository once they are sure it is up to snuff, avoiding confusing failed-attempt files, leaving one repo pristine. </p>
