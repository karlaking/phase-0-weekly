		<h2>Reflections on Wireframing<h2>
		<p>A wireframe is a critical part of the web design process. It is the stage that addresses the design and function of the web site. It is a vague rendering of what content and features will be present on the page.<p/>
		<p>Wireframing eleminates confusion during the web development process by organizing the project, and essentially making a to-do list of what features need to be researched or what content should be developed.</p>
		<p>Wireframing was really helpful in visualizing what code is needed to support a website. I enjoyed the experience and learned how ux design is part of our concern, too.</p>
		<p>I revised my wireframe during the process. I had a different idea of how the webpage should be structured.</p>
		<p>I was a bit stuck on one of my branches not merging properly. I just stuck with it until I found a solution to push everything to GitHub. I'm not sure if it was the correct way, but it worked.</p>
		<p>Nothing seems tideous at this point in the program. Everything is new and welcomed! I enjoyed being able to see a graphic of a potential output. It helps tie things together.</p>
