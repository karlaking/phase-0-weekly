<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  Instant gratification with html. You're able to switch parameters and syntax quickly and view their purpose in real time. It is fun to experiment. 
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
The HTML semantic elements are pretty intuitive. I like the logic of using the opening and closing tags. I got hung up on the execution of adding a picture/link combination for the Geico logo, otherwise researching worked every time.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Very well. At one point we considered changing the font size using a header to better match the original website’s, but chose not to because it did not follow semantics. 
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I like the logic of HTML. I like that it is not concerned with the visual design aspects. It doesn’t seem to be very buggy that I’ve noticed. I don’t have anything bad to say about html yet.  I am sure that will change.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
The common tags are pretty easy to remember; otherwise I have a growing cheat-sheet of complex tags.  I’m curious to know what others are doing!
