	<li> What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?</li> 
	<p>My site is intended to demonstrate mapping projects I’ve completed and the techniques used to do so. The content will feature a LOT of images (maps and aerial photographs) as well as paragraphs and diagrams to explain methods.<p>
	<li> What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?</li>
	<p>My target audience are mapping enthusiasts and those who may be potential clients in the future after I have developed good techniques. This poses an issue because the audience will span the technical crowd to farmers or construction managers. My site will be address this issue by going into technical details on a separate tab called “Methods” accompanied by more introductory content on other pages. Diagrams, images, and maps will also be of interest to people of all technical levels!</p>
	<li>What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.</li>
	<p>I am hoping people will contact me to collaborate on mapping projects or to volunteer to have me use their farm or site as a test mapping area.</p>
	<li> What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?</li>
	<p>Design and User Experience are essential elements of web development. They address and inform how the rest of the web development project will be implemented.  UX make sure a visitor is not turned off by the design or ability to navigate.</p>
	<li> What is user experience design and why is it valuable?</li>
	<p>User experience is an individual’s attitude towards a website or product for that matter. It is the application to improve client/customers/visitors experience to improve the chances they will have a positive impression of the product.</p>
	<li> Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</li>
	<p>The most tedious part of this challenge was considering how form should follow function. During the design planning stage, an individual needs to consider how the aesthetics can enhance your website’s effectiveness. I haven’t done much work in design, and would prefer to deal with the logic and content of a site, so UX is a hard subject for me.</p>
