# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input? an array, size of integer, possible value to pad the array, any class
# What is the output? an array 
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# Check length of the array to see if it is less than min_size
# If it is not, we pass back the array
# If it is less, we must pad the array 
  # Find the difference between elements in the array and the min_size
  # Create a variable to pad the array 
  # Add the variable to the array until it equals the min_size
# Return modified array 
# End 
 #1. Initial Solution

def pad!(array, min_size, value = nil) #destructive
  diff = min_size - array.length 
  if diff <= 0 
    return array 
  else diff.times {array.push(value)}
    return array 
  end
end
=end

def pad(array, min_size, value = nil) #non-destructive
  new_array = array.dup
  diff = min_size - array.length
  if diff <= 0 
    return new_array
  else diff.times {new_array.push(value)}
    return new_array
  end
end
=end


# 3. Refactored Solution
def pad!(array, min_size, value = nil) #destructive
  diff = min_size - array.length 
  diff <= 0 ? array : diff.times {array.push(value)}
  array
end

def pad(array, min_size, value = nil) #non-destructive
  new_array = array.dup
  diff = min_size - array.length
  diff <= 0 ? new_array : diff.times {new_array.push(value)}
  new_array
